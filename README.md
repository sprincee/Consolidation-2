# Consolidation-2


Welcome to the Eldrow Game Manuel!

Eldrow is word-guessing game, which from a chosen theme, provides a word formatted with underscores, and calls upon you, the user to guess the letters, and ultimately the secret word. However, beware! You only have three word guesses, but infinite letter guesses, so keep that in mind. At the end, you may come to realize a funny truth...

How to Run the Game:

1. Download the .py file, known as EldrowGame.py & save it in your chosen directory.
2. Open your desired terminal or command-prompt & navigate to the directory where you downloaded EldrowGame.py
3. Run the script, via the following command: 'python EldrowGame.py'
4. ENSURE that game_v2.py as well as EldrowGame.py are in the SAME directory -- DOWNLOAD game_v2.py as well.

How to Play!:

1. Initially, the game will start by asking you for a username & if you'd like to see the rules.
2. Following that, you'll be prompted with a list of themes to choose from (all fun, try all of them!)
3. Once a theme is chosen, you'll be thrown into the game.
4. To play, input letters as guesses, or even words! Depending on your input, you'll see the screen change. (right ans, wrong ans, invalid ans, etc.)
5. If you are lucky enough to guess the word, you'll be given your score (the lower amount of guesses, the better!) and you'll be provided a brief view of the credits before you can play again!

Game Limitations:

1. As of Release 1.1, the game cannot dicern strings with mixed types (i.e 'n00b') as invalid inputs.
2. As of Release 1.1, the game cannot handle symbolic-only inputs properly (i.e '!@#$%'), so don't input those.
3. As of Release 1.1, the bank of words is quite small & only three themes are provided, replayability is not high.
4. As of Release 1.1, the game cannot run without user input, as it waits for the user to provide input to move on.
